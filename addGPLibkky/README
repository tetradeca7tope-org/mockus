addGPMargLikelihood: Performs additive GP regression but here the groups in the
  additive GP are known. Maximizes the GP marginal likelihood to learn the
  bandwidth and scale.

addGPRotMargLikelihood: Performs additive GP regression but now attempts to find
  the grouping. Here, the groups are obtained by grouping  the coordinates
  in any orthogonal basis.

addGPUGMargLikelihood: Performs additive GP regression again with unknown
  groups. But this time the coordinates basis is known so you are just trying to
  group the variables together.

addGPDecompMargLikelihood: Wroet on Sat Dec 27 to try and handle all addGP
  functions via the same interface. Can only handle permutation matrices.
